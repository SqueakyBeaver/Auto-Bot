This is a simple discord bot I used to get the hang of background tasks in [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

Running
=======
To run, you need Python 3.7 or later
You also need the following packages: [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html), [`discord.py`](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/), and [`aiohttp`](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)
You can simply run the `python3 src/bot.py` (if you have something else, you know what you're doing)


Notice
------
Sorry if `Auto-Bot` is copyrighted or something, I literally just put `auto` (from automated messages because this bot sends automated messages) and `bot` (because it is a Discord bot) on 2 ends of a hyphen (`-`), so if you get upset, you have issues.
